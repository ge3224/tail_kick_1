# Tailkick — A WordPress Theme Utilizing <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a>.

------

TailKick offers WordPress site owners a fresh look and theme builders an
alternative developer experience.

WordPress users can switch their websites to the TailKick theme in the usual
way. Without editing template files, CSS, or PHP, they can personalize
TailKick's look using their unique content and the WordPress Customizer API.

For folks interested in working with TailKick's codebase, those who may create
a new theme based on TailKick, or folks interested contributing to this
project, I recommend the Tailwind CSS framework and its challenge of CSS best
practices.

Tailwind CSS describes itself as a "utility-first CSS framework." In other
words, it is an extensive collection of class selectors mapped to carefully
constrained rulesets — "primitive utilities." You style HTML elements by adding
and removing Tailwind classes in your markup. Tailwind users often say it
increases their productivity and it is easier to manage as their projects grow
in complexity.
